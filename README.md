# Introduction

MYSTRAN is a general purpose finite element analysis computer program for structures that can be modeled as linear (i.e. displacements, forces and stresses proportional to applied load). MYSTRAN is an acronym for “My Structural Analysis”, to indicate it’s usefulness in solving a wide variety of finite element analysis problems.

For anyone familiar with the popular NASTRAN computer program developed by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) in the 1970’s and popularized in several commercial versions since, the input to MYSTRAN will look quite familiar. Many structural analyses modeled for execution in NASTRAN will execute in MYSTRAN with little, or no, modification. MYSTRAN, however, is not NASTRAN. It is an independent program written in modern Fortran 95.

[Currently I'd post this link](https://www.mystran.com/forums/showthread.php?tid=2) But I think that's not good enough, this should be in a docs directory in the github repository so that version control of it can be done properly. Ideally it would be just as a PDF generated by something like LATEX so that anybody could contribute things like edits to it. Barring that it should be in some kind of open office format so that anybody could access it without paying 130 bucks for microsoft word.
