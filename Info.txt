This is the 1st incidence of the MYSTRAN repository on GitHub. Besides
the source code, there are batch files and perl scripts that I
(Bill Case) use to perform the compilation and linking using Lahey
Express Fortran in a batch process. That process and the batch and perl
scripts are on the MYSTRAN-FEA-Program ver ?.?? zip file and are 
described in detail in the document:

01-Procedure for Batch Compiling and Linking MYSTRAN in directory:

MYSTRAN\BAT\Comp-and-Link

after installing MYSTRAN. I have all of this stored on a D: drive and
the batch files presume this. However, it would be a simple process
for anyone to modify a few batch files and perl scripts to accomodate
any other drive
